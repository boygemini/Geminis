## Issues

This sample shows you how to integrate with [a specific Stripe feature (link here)](). Please only file issues here that you believe represent bugs with this particular sample, not [the feature itself (link here)]() itself.

If you're having general trouble with a Stripe feature, please reach out to us using the form at <https://support.stripe.com/email>, or come chat with us on the [Stripe Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rujnsbxrqn). We're very proud of our level of service, and we're more than happy to help you out with your integration.

If you've found a bug in any of the implementations in this repository, please [let us know (add link to sample's new issue page)]()!

## Code review

All pull requests will be reviewed by someone from Stripe before merging. At
Stripe, we believe that code review is for explaining and having a discussion
around code. For those new to code review, we strongly recommend [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjmw9trb7s) on "code review culture."
